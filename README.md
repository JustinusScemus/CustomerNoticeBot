# Customer Notice Bot
by Justin Sham (JustinusScemus)

It fetches customer notices on routes of Franchised Bus companies in Hong Kong, namely Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB), Citybus and New Lantao Bus (NLB).

After cloning the Python source code to local machine, you should create the `secret.py` defining the following names:
- `TOKEN`: The token used by this Discord bot to login;
- `TEXTCHANNEL_ID`: The id of the Text Channel to send normal messages to; and
- `ERRORCHANNEL_ID`: The id of the Text Channel to send error message to

After starting the script, it automatically initialises the the files.

Expected update for the next version (Version 6):

Addition of notification of either MTR Bus or major GMB company(ies), such as Ma Ah Muk or AMS
